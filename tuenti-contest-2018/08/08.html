	<h2><strong>Challenge 8</strong> - Security by doorscurity</h2>
	<p>
    Hello agent your mission is to infiltrate a secure research facility
</p>
<p>
    From some intel work, we know some security measures to keep intruders out. In this case the most dangerous ones
    is hallways filled with a corrosive gas that would fairly quickly penetrate any protection you might bring<br>
    The hallways are designed to keep people in it long enough for the gas to do its work.
</p>
<p>
    Another operative has managed to get the specifications of the hallway.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each hallway has a number of doors</li>
    <li>Each door opens at a determined interval and remains open for one <i>unit of time</i></li>
    <li>It takes you one <i>unit of time</i> to cross the space between doors.</li>
    <li>There is a panel at each end that shows the current state of the hallway.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In order to survive the hallway with your equipment, you need to 
find a moment when you can get down it in one go without stopping.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
    The first line has an integer <b>C</b>, which is the number of cases for the problem.<br>
    Each case starts with a line with an integer <b>D</b>, which is the number of doors in the hallway.<br>
    <b>D</b> lines follow, two integers <b>P</b> and <b>T</b>, indicating that the door opens every <b>P</b> 
		units of time and that <b>T</b> units of time have passed since the last time it opened, relative to the
		time you get to the hallway	(e.g. P = 10, T = 6 means the door will open at 4(10-6) and then every 
		10 <i>units of time</i>).

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case, there should be a line starting with "Case #x: " 
followed by the earliest moment in time (relative to your arrival at the
 hallway panel) when you can go the hallway in one go without stopping, 
but if that never happens, output <em>NEVER</em>. Every line is followed by a new line character.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>
    In Case 1 the answer is 5, 5 <i>units of time</i> after you arrival you start running, the first door should be open,
    and the second door opens at 6, just as you are crossing the space between the doors<br>
    In Case 2 the answer is 248, you cross door 1 at 248, door 2 at 249 and door 3 at 250<br>
    In Case 3 the answer is <em>NEVER</em><br>
    In Case 4 the answer is 711399, you cross door 1 at 711399, door 2 at 711400, door 3 at 711401 and door 4 at 711402
