	<h2><strong>Challenge 2</strong> - Hidden numbers</h2>
	<p>The Nazi air force is trying to transmit numbers (maybe representing
 army units or available stock) over the radio and the Enigma code has 
just been broken, so they try to find out a pen and paper solution to 
send those numbers in a sort of secret manner. They decide to encode 
them on an arbitrary base using arbitrary symbols to represent the 
number. The good thing is that we only care about the order of magnitude
 of such numbers and their minimum and maximum possible values.</p>

<p>
You're given a string with characters a-z representing a number. You 
don't know for sure what base it's in and what digit on that base each 
character represents.
But you know, however, that all digits in the base are present just one 
time in the input string.
</p>

You have to calculate the difference between the minimum and maximum 
possible values. Bear in mind that the numbers never have leading 
zeroes.

<h3>Input</h3>
The first line has one integer, <b>T</b>, which is the number of test cases.
For each case, there is a line with a string of lowercase characters, <b>S</b>.

<h3>Output</h3>
For each line, output “Case #x: ” followed by the difference between the
 minimum and maximum possible values, as a decimal value.

<h3>Limits</h3>
2 ≤ length(S) ≤ 26

<h3>Sample input</h3>
<pre>3
bfd
xwyz
qwerty
</pre>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<pre>Case #1: 10
Case #2: 153
Case #3: 36445
</pre>

In the first case (bfd), these are all the possibilities and their values

<style>
#p20table td {
		text-align: center;
		padding: 5px;
		border: 1px;
}
</style>

<table id="p20table">
<tbody><tr> <td><b>Number</b></td> <td><b>Decimal value</b></td> </tr>
<tr> <td>102</td> <td>11</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>120</td> <td>15</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>210</td> <td>21</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>201</td> <td>19</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

The maximum value is 21 and the minimum is 11, so the solution is 10. 
Remember that numbers with leading zeroes are not allowed, so both 012 
and 021 are not valid.
