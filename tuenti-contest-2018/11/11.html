	<h2><strong>Challenge 11</strong> - Lasers</h2>
	<style>
    sup {
        vertical-align: super;
        font-size: smaller;
    }
</style>

<p>One of the most prestigious jewelry shops in the world is having a unique week long exposition of their best items.</p><p>

</p><p>The venue will be one of the most secure in the world. An NxM 
meter rectangular room with perpendicular lasers and sensors on opposing
 walls, separated by one meter, with a maximum of N + M lasers.</p><p>

</p><p>The hosts are happy with the security provided, but they're also 
worried about the items, which are extremely delicate and continuous 
exposure to lasers could damage them. Specifically, items can only be 
hit by one laser.</p>

<p>To simplify things, a laser is considered to hit an item when it goes through the 1 x 1 meter cell containing the item.</p>

<p>The hosts have come to you with the arrangement of the items. As 
chief of security for the venue it's your job to maximize the security 
of the event or, in other words, to cram as many lasers as possible in 
the venue without upsetting the hosts.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer <b>C</b>, which is the number of cases for the problem.<br>
Each case starts with a line with three integers <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>I</b>, which are the dimensions of the venue and the number of items. <b>I</b> lines follow, each with two integers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, that indicate that an item is in position (<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>).</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case, there should be a line starting with "Case #x: " followed by the maximum number of lasers that fit in the venue.</p>
