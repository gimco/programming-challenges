</style>

<p>After long weeks of struggle you survived the battle against those terrible pagans! A celebration is in order!</p><p>

</p><p>The main event will be a group dance to honor your god and, as 
the senior dance instructor, you are in charge of organizing it. You're 
thinking about arranging everyone in a circle with the person at 12 
o'clock being P<sub>0</sub> and the next person in clockwise order being P<sub>1</sub>, etc.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be going well during practice until today when 
you discovered a major oversight on your part: during the highlight of 
the dance everyone walks up to their partner and does a couple's dance. 
The tricky part is that partners aren't necessarily adjacent so when two
 partners walk towards each other they might run into other people!</p>

<p>To complicate matters even more, a person might hate someone and will never accept him/her as their partner.</p>

<p>Now, with just a few days left before the start of the grand festival
 you want to know how many ways you can pair everyone up so you can 
decide on the final arrangement.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line has an integer <b>C</b>, which is the number of cases for our problem.<br>
Each case starts with a line with two integers <b>P</b> and <b>G</b>, which are the number of people and the number of grudges. <b>G</b> lines follow, each with two integers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> that indicate person <b>P<sub>A</sub></b> hates person <b>P<sub>B</sub></b>.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case there should be a line starting with "Case #x: " followed by the number of different ways people can be arranged, <strong>modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7</strong>. Every line is followed by a new line character.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<table style="width:100%"><tbody><tr>
<td><pre>Case 1:

2 0





</pre></td><td><pre>Case 2:

3 0





</pre></td>
<td><pre>Case 3:

6 0





</pre></td>
<td><pre>Case 4:

8 5
0 4
5 0
6 1
3 6
2 7
</pre></td>
</tr></tbody></table>

<p>In Case 1 there is only a single way to arrange the two people.<br>
In Case 2 there is no way to assign partners to three people.<br>
In Case 3 you can arrange everyone in 5 different ways:</p>
<p>
	<img style="display: block; margin: 40px auto" src="../resources/dance6.png" alt="case 3">
</p>

<p>In Case 4 you can arrange everyone in 7 different ways:</p>
<p>
	<img style="display: block; margin: 40px auto" src="../resources/dance8.png" alt="case 4">
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 ≤ <b>P</b> ≤ 1000</li>
<li>1 ≤ <b>G</b> ≤ (<b>P</b> * (<b>P</b> - 1)) / 2</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>4
2 0
3 0
6 0
8 5
0 4
5 0
6 1
3 6
2 7
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>Case #1: 1
Case #2: 0
Case #3: 5
Case #4: 7
</pre>
