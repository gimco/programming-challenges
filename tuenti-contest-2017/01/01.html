<p>
	We love pizza. You love pizza. And your friends love pizza too. You are hosting a party
	tomorrow, and you want to have enough pizza for everyone. Following the widely-known
	standards, every pizza is cut into 8 slices, and you know the maximum number of pizza
	slices that each person will eat. You want to know the minimum number of pizzas you 
	need to	order so that nobody goes hungry during the party.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
	In the first line, an integer <b>T</b> indicates the number of cases.
</p>

<p>
	Each case consists of two lines. The first one contains a number <b>N</b>, the number of
	people attending the party. The second line contains N numbers, representing the maximum number
	of pizza slices that each guest eats (<b>S</b>).
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
	For each case, a line starting with "Case #x: " followed by the minimum number of pizzas
	you	need to order to ensure that nobody goes hungry.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<ul>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>T</strong> ≤ 100</li>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>N</strong> ≤ 10000</li>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>S</strong> ≤ 100</li>
</ul>


<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>3
3
8 8 8
2
5 3
4
3 4 5 6
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>Case #1: 3
Case #2: 1
Case #3: 3
</pre>

<p>
	In the first case, each of the three attendees eats an entire pizza, so the answer is 3.<br>
	In the second case, the two attendees eat 8 slices, so a single pizza is enough for them.<br>
	In the third case, the answer is 3:<br>
	</p><ul>
		<li>Attendees #1 and #3 eat an entire pizza together (3+5=8)</li>
		<li>Attendee #2 eats 4 slices of a second pizza</li>
		<li>Attendee #4 eats up to 6 pizza slices, but only 4 remain from the second pizza, so we need another one.</li>
	</ul>
