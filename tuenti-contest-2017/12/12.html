	<h2><strong>Challenge 12</strong> - That’s a lot of moneyz</h2>
	<p>
	Your friend has a lot of spare coins and asks you for help as the town’s fastest money-counter.
	However, you recently had some technical problems and ended up using your teapot as a router,
	so the photos coming through are a little bit corrupted. But that’s no problem for you, am I right?

<p>
	As you can guess after seeing the image, your friend uses euro coins, and each time he sends you a photo
	you will have to tell him how much money (in cents) is in the image. Remember that 1 and 2 euro coins are
	equivalent to 100 and 200 cents each!
