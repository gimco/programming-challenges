	<h2><strong>Challenge 9</strong> - The Supreme Scalextric Architect</h2>
	<style>

</style>

<p>After many years of pursuing the role, you have been hired as The Supreme Scalextric Architect in a company producing slot car racing tracks. As such, your job is to design the longest and coolest possible Scalextric circuits.</p>

<p>Your company is still new, and for now it only creates three types of basic track sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Straight sections (S)</li>
<li>90-degree curves (C)</li>
<li>Double length straight sections (D)</li>
</ul>

<p>All types of sections are designed to be easily interoperable, so they all have the same square dimensions (a D section has the same size as two S sections put together).<br>
All sections are flat, no section is designed to intersect or go over or under another.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line will contain an integer <b>N</b>, the number of cases for our problem.<br>
Each case consists of a line with three integers separated by spaces: <b>S</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>, with each representing the number of available sections of the type identified by the corresponding letter.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case, a line starting with "Case #x: " followed by the maximum number of sections which can form a closed circuit. If no circuit can be formed with the existing sections, the output will be 0.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<table style="width:100%"><tbody><tr>
<td><pre>Case 1:

5 2 7
</pre></td>
<td><pre>Case 2:

0 4 0
</pre></td>
<td><pre>Case 3:

3 7 1
</pre></td>
</tr></tbody></table>

<p>In Case 1, the answer is 0, as it's not possible to create a closed circuit with the given sections.<br>
In Case 2, the answer is 4. You can make a circle-shaped circuit with the 4 curved sections.<br>
In case 3, the answer is 9. You can use every given section except for a single straight and a single curved section. An example circuit would be:</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<ul>
<li>0 ≤ <b>S, C, D</b> ≤ 500</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

3 7 1</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
