	<h2><strong>Challenge 10</strong> - Passwords</h2>
	<p>
	You have proudly worked for almost five years in a leading technological company.
	One day, you realized that the disk of your main employee authentication server was
	becoming full, and you started deleting some unnecessary stuff until you had enough
	space to install some videogames. However, five minutes later you were informed
	that the authentication had stopped working for all the company's employees.
</p>

<p>
	After some investigation, you realize that you have accidentally deleted the whole
	password database from the disk, and that all its backups met the same fate every time
	you previously wanted to install more videogames.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
	<img src="../resources/img/passwords.png" style="border-radius:10px; border:1px solid #999">
</p>

<p>
	Since you don't want anyone to discover that you've been using one of the company's
	most important servers to play videogames, you somehow need to rebuild the passwords.
	Thankfully, all those passwords were obtained from the password generation script and
	you have <a href="passwords-repo.tar.gz">its source code</a> downloaded,
	so maybe you can save yourself from being fired and from	having to reinstall all your
	games	on another company's server.
</p>

<p>
	Once you download the password generation history, you realize that most of them were
	generated using older versions of the script. What's more, many users have their passwords
	regenerated. You know that a new version of the script was generated <b>every day</b>, with no
	exceptions, and that some of the commits might have been moved onto branches or even
	accidentally deleted.
</p>

<p>
	But time is running out; can you find all the scripts and recover all the passwords?
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
	In the first line, an integer <b>T</b> indicates the number of cases.
</p>

<p>
	Each case represents a user's password history, and is described by <b>N</b>+1 lines.
	The first line of each case contains the word <b>U</b>, corresponding to its userid,
	and the integer <b>N</b>, representing the number of entries that exist for that user.
	After that, <b>N</b> lines follow containing the string <b>D</b>, which represents the
	generation date in <i>yyyy-mm-dd</i> format and the integer <b>C</b>, representing
	the number of times that user password was changed on that date.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
	For each case, a line starting with "Case #x: " followed by the most recent password for that user.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

	<li>1 ≤ <strong>N</strong> ≤ 1800</li>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>C</strong> ≤ 10000</li>
